# Scene Separation & Data Selection (work in progress)
This repo contains the Scene Separation and Data Selection Algorithm used for real-time video stream analysis.
> This algorithm is a work featured in IJCAI 2022 workshop [**Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning**](https://strl2022.github.io/).

### Slides and Papers
Go to `/slides` for the oral presentation slides, go to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00210) for the paper.

### TO DO List
> 1. add the previously implemented code to this repo    
> 2. refine 2SDS architecture
> 3. consider a **graph neural network** approach
