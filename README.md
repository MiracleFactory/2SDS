# Scene Separation & Data Selection (work in progress)
This repo contains the Scene Separation and Data Selection Algorithm used for real-time video stream analysis.
> This algorithm is a work featured in IJCAI 2022 workshop [**Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning**](https://strl2022.github.io/).
